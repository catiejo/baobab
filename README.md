# Arracher Des Baobabs
## _Enfants, faites attention aux baobabs!_
A small game based on Le Petit Prince. Don't let them grow too big--fly around the planet by dragging your finger (or mouse) and pick them by tapping. The game is over when 5 baobabs are fully grown.

I created this little game as a way to teach myself Unity. I came up with the concept, wrote all the code, built the scenes, wrote and performed the soundtrack, and drew all the textures.
